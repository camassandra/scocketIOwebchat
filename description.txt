Me and my project mate are lagging behind with group project (webshop). 
Time is running short and I have planned a gorup project where I can learn 
and showcase a lot of new features (good understanding of relational database organization, 
generating a unique random order number, 
get date for an order and set date for delivery, send reminder sms, custom URL)




Therefore, I will create a chat using scocket.io as a final project
